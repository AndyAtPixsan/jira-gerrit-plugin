JIRA-Gerrit integration plugin.

* "Gerrit Reviews" issue tab panel to show all reviews related to the issue (must have the issue key in the commit message)
* Workflow condition to require that an issue must (or must not) have any open reviews
* Workflow condition to require that an issue must (or must not) have a certain approval score (e.g., CRVW == 2, or ! VRIF < 0)
* Workflow function to perform a Gerrit review.  This is just an argument to the `gerrit review [ChangeId] ..` command, so it could be something like `--verified +1` to give a +1 score; or `--submit` to submit the change.
** The Gerrit user configured in the admin panel must have access to perform all necessary steps.

TODO:
* Unit Tests
* Possibly per-user SSH key configurations (instead of everything done as a JIRA user)?
* Possibly allow a second "suexec" SSH key so the JIRA user can spoof another Gerrit user?
* Extend SshConnection in order to obtain stderr content, to know if a command failed.
